## Project Description

One of my Digital Technology and Culture courses was working with an outside individual/brand to help them modernize their website. I was paired with Cowboy Ted, a children's 'edu-tainment' brand that focuses on teaching children about themselves with a focus on rural activities and themes. The brand was looking for a complete overhaul of their website to make it more modern and user-friendly. The course involved working with the client to understand their needs and wants, creating a design proposal, and presenting it to the client. 

The client asked me to fully implement the changes we outlined in our design proposal white paper, which included a complete overhaul of the website using Wix. The website was built from the ground up, with a focus on making it more modern and user-friendly. The website was designed to be responsive and accessible, with a focus on making it easy for parents and children to navigate. The website was also designed to be easy to update and maintain, with a focus on making it easy for the client to add new content and make changes as needed. This website required the building of multiple custom displays, including a video player and picker. The website also required the integration of multiple services, including a payment gateway and a newsletter signup form, as well as account management and user authentication for paywalled content.
